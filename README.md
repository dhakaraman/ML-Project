# ML-Project

## Objective:  We want to use ML techniques to help predict stock prices of various companies.
 The companies which we have chosen are:
    Amazon  
    TCS 
    Thomas Cook India
    Coca-cola company
    Tesla
    

 We intend to analyse various ML models on the available data for the given companies. we have trained 4 diffeent models, Linear Regression (SDG), Support-vector machine (SVM), Convoluted Nueral Network (CNN) and Long-short term memory model (LSTM).
 
 # How to Run the project
For each model user can find different files in the root folder named with the name of the model

1. For analysis of SVM and SGD user can find the python notebook as SVM__and_SGD.ipynb. To run the file click the below button or download it and run the file using jupyter notebook.

2. For analysis of CNN model user can find the python notebook as CNN.ipynb.
To run the file click the below button or download it and run the file using jupyter notebook.

3. For analysis of LSTM model user can find the python notebook as LSTM.ipynb.

For running the analysis user needs to download the data for all the companies it can be found in the data folder of in the root directory(click below links for the data diretory).

Traing data : [Training Data for 5 companies](https://github.com/dhakaraman/ML-Project/tree/main/data)
Here you can see the data named as [company_name].csv for 5 different companies.

Testing Data : [Testing Data for 5 companies](https://github.com/dhakaraman/ML-Project/tree/main/data/test)
Here you can see the data named as [company_name_test].csv for 5 different companies.

You need to download the data and upload it on google colab.

In the above image you can see a highlighted box. You can upload the files in the google colab using this button. After opening the file to be analysed in google colab

# Data Preprocessing:
Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualisation was carried on out on the training data and the results are present in the Data Analysis folder, the file ML_proj.ipynb contains all the visualisation graphs for each of the company selected. Some of the features were dropped due to their unrelated nature from the problem in hand.

# Results and Analysis
Results are compiled in the Report and were presented during the presentation. The plots are presented in the plots folder.
