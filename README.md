# ML-Project

## Objective:  We want to use ML techniques to help predict stock prices of various companies.
 The companies which we have chosen are:
    Amazon  
    TCS 
    Thomas Cook India
    Coca-cola company
    Tesla
    
<!--   ###   Amazon
  ###   TCS
  ###   Thomas cook India
  ###   Tesla
  ###   Coca-cola company -->
 We intend to analyse various ML models on the available data for the given companies. we have trained 4 diffeent models, Linear Regression (SDG), Support-vector machine (SVM), Convoluted Nueral Network (CNN) and Long-short term memory model (LSTM).

# Results and Analysis


We trained a few models, the ipynb files regarding all of them are also present.
